# C# TODO App 

This is an example repository to manage your todo list with simple JSON file. The JSON file is stored locally. To run locally, follow these steps; 

- Clone this repository
- Enter the directory: ``bin/Debug``.
- Run the ``.exe`` file.

## Important Note
Plesase do NOT change the ``.exe`` file directory. If you; you will get some errors. I know this bug and will fix it.
